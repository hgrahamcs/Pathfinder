# Pathfinder

Educational grid based pathfinding tool and library powered by react.

## Introduction

This project is an educational Grid based Pathfinding tool written in Typescript that visualizes pathfinding and maze generation algorithms on a web browser! You can find an online demo [here](https://josephprichard.github.io/Pathfinder).

This is is the react version of an older project I made: [here](https://github.com/JosephPrichard/PathfindingVisualizer)

## Build Process

You can open the development server with
```
npm start
```

You can create a production build with
```
npm run build
```

Project was deployed to gh pages with 
```
npm run deploy
```

## Library

This project also contains a standalone library for pathfinding on a 2D grid.

The grid is based around 3 fundamental interfaces contained in ../pathfinding/core/Components

Point, which represents an x,y location on the grid.
TileData, which stores the solidity of a tile and the cost to travel to a tile if it isn't solid.
Tile, which stores Point and TileData, representing a Vertex on the Grid.

We can create a grid with a width of 10 and a height of 5 like so:
```
const grid = new Grid(10, 5);
```

Let's say we wanted to make the tile at (5,3) solid, so we can't travel there:
```
const point = {x: 5, y: 3};
const data = {pathCost: 1, isSolid: true};
grid.mutate(point, data);
```

If we wanted to get the tile at the point (4,6) we would do it like this:
```
grid.get({x: 4, y: 6});
```

The grid class contains minimal bound checks to speed up processing but we can check the boundaries on 
the grid with these helpful functions:
```
grid.inBounds(point);
grid.getWidth();
grid.getHeight();
```

This project also contains Pathfinders which can find the best path (capable by the algorithm) between an initial and goal point.

If we want to initialize a pathfinder we need to pass it a navigator.

A navigator is a class that encapsulates the grid by determining what tiles we can travel to from a given point. The project
contains two build in navigators, but you can make your own as long as they inherit from the abstract Navigator Class in ../pathfinding/core/Navigator.

If we wanted to initialize the "PlusNavigator" which allows movement in 4 directions (up,left,right,down) we can do so like:
```
const navigator = new PlusNavigator(grid);
```

We can access the neighbors of the point (3,3) like so:
```
const neighbors: Tile[] = navigator.neighbors({x: 3, y:3});
```

Now we can initialize a pathfinder that uses the AStar algorithm like this:
```
const pathfinder = new AStarPathfinder(navigator);
```

If we wanted to find the shortest path on the grid from (0,0) to (4,3) we would do it like this:
```
const initial = {x: 0, y: 0};
const goal = {x: 4, y: 3};
const path: Tile[] = pathfinder.findPath(initial, goal);
```

The AStar algorithm uses the Manhattan distance heuristic by default but you can find other heuristics in ../pathfinding/algorithms/Heuristics.

Lastly, we can randomly generate mazes with the TerrainMazeGenerator class:
```
const generator = new TerrainMazeGenerator(width, height);
```

We can invoke the random generation algorithm (recursive division) like:
```
const maze: Grid = generator.generateTerrain();
```
