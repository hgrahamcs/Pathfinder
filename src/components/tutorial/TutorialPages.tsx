                    This application is a tool for visualizing pathfinding algorithms.
                    Pathfinding algorithms seek to find the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.
                    This application has adapted the algorithms to perform on a grid where vertices are tiles and
                    edges are 90 degree paths between adjacent tiles.
                </div>
                <div className='tutorial-subtext'>
                    &emsp;&emsp;
                    Some pathfinding algorithms are <i>weighted</i> while other algorithms are <i>unweighted</i>.
                    Weighted algorithms take into account the cost to travel to a tile, and therefore always find the shortest path.
                    Unweighted algorithms don't take into account the cost to travel to a tile, and don't always find the shortest path.
                    The shortest path is the path with the lowest cost between the two points.

                    Click and drag on the empty tiles to draw walls or weights.
                    Click and drag on filled tiles to erase.
                    Click the purple drop down menu to change which wall or weight to draw.

                    Walls cannot be traveled to, and are therefore not explored by any of the algorithms.
                    Weights can be traveled to, however they are more costly to travel to. For example,
                    Weight[5] is 5 times more costly to travel to than an empty tile.

                    You can move the start and goal nodes by clicking them and dragging them.

                        Out of these algorithms, it is the most expensive to perform and often checks the most nodes.

                        Widely considered to be one of the best pathfinding algorithms.

                        Explores a low amount of nodes, but doesn't guarantee the shortest path.
